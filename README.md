# Is $\hat \beta$ consistent under realistic case?

For this project, I consider the following the PA model: $Y_i|X_i \sim N_n(X_i\beta, V(\epsilon_0))$

1. We first simulate data which have a homoskedastic AR(1) covariance structure.
2. Fitting the PA linear model to data with a misspecified aggregate covariance matrix $V(\epsilon_1))$. Under the realistic case, the PA mean model is correctly specified while the aggregate covariance matrix is misspecified.
3. Monte Carlo simulation.
4. Performance measures to evaluate consistency of $\hat \beta$.
5. Change sample size m.
